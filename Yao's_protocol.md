# Yao's Protocol

#### A protocol for general secure two-party computation

- Consatant number of rounds
- The basics protocol is secure only for semi-honest adversaries
- Many applications of the methodology beyond secure computation.

#### General Secure Computation

- Can securely compute any functionality
- Based on a represntation of the functionality as a Boolean circuit.

This protocol is used against semi-honest adversaries.
