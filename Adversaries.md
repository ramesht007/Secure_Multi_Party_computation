# Modeling Adversaries

## Adversarial behavior

**Semi-honest:** Follows the protocol specification
- Tries to learn more than allowed by inspecting transcript

**Malicious:**  Follows any arbitrary strategy.

**Covert:** Follows any arbitrary strategy, but is averse to being caught...... 

### For Example:
- Two Hospitals want to carry out secure computation over the unoin of their databases but they donot trust each other as the hospitals 
might not want to have a sneak peak over the data and they might not even try. But we cannot say the same for the IT depratment they might 
try to get hands on some of the data form the other hospital. One does not want their's hospitals data to lie around in someone else server.
This type is called semi-honest Adversaries.
