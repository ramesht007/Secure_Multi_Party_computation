# Exceution Setting

### Stand alone

Consider a single protocol execution only (or that only a single execution is under attack).

### Concurrent general composition

- Arbitrary protocols executed concurrently
- Realistic setting, very important model

### Stand-alone vs compositon

- **Stand-alone:**: A good place to start studying secure computation, techniques and tools are helpful.
- **Compositon:** True goal for construction.
